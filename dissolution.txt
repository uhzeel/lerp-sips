I have sprayed the repellant,
But they still won't leave me alone.

While I try to stir the pixels on my screen,
My milk's gone cold.

Where will my thoughts be
when you get back to me?

The importance of punctuation
in poetry, was ne'er understood
by high school me
or middle school me
or the now before me;
now being the me in the now,
which we're long past,
for this commit shall be laid to rest,
in an anti-branch, oh.
